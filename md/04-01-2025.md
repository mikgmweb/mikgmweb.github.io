# insanely lucky day

i'm gonna place this here just because i think it's a good idea to write it down so i can look back at it in a good while.<br>...<br>i was walking to my friend's a capella group's a capella showcase and i ran into one of my other friends. turns out, she's hanging out with someone that works at epic games of all places and we connect on instagram (WOOHOO!!!!!). then, while stopped at a crosswalk, one of my other friends is stopped at a stoplight, first in line... so we have a conversation across traffic. AND THEN i was buying a ticket for the event at the kiosk, and someone approaches me there and offers me a FREE ticket!<br>...<br>finally, on the way back home, i ran into my old roommate and we caught up a little. what are the chances of a day like that???
