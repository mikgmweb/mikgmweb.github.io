# the lua script in question

the <a href="https://mote.moe/scripts/mdconvert.lua">lua script</a> i created essentially takes a template file i have in a secret special location (that you can find by looking at the script) and fills in some key words i put in there with content from my markdown file. it's a little limiting, but that's to be expected since i'm a lua novice.

# stop reading now if you HATE programming

lemme break it down.<br>the script starts out by taking user input of the filename to be converted to html using an existing template file<br> [[CODE]] <br>then, i create a variable to convert the filename format to *.html , which enables it to be used with our first function: printtable. it does what it says on the tin with two parameters: the table and the filename.<br>[[CODE]]<br>then i make a function to check if a file exists and return a boolean<br>[[CODE]]<br>the next function uses that boolean for some error management, then makes the input file into a table usable by lua.<br>[[CODE]]<br>finally, a simple function to count the length of a table
