  <hr>
  <p class="post">i went to denver with my wonderful partner to meet up with her family for thanksgiving. it was a great
    time. my spanish has gotten markedly better than the last time i went. honestly i feel like the practice i've gotten
    through my job is really one of the only good things it has brought me. spanish has given me a pretty rough go of
    it – rather i've made it rough for myself by not practicing!!! it's nice to observe that hard work paying off.</p>
  <p class="post">...</p>
  <p class="post">aside from being immersed in the language, i was as immersed in her culture as i feel i've been since
    we started dating. i loved every second of it. i think my further immersion is a result of both having established
    myself as her partner simply through the passage of time and also being able to communicate things a little better
    in her family's native language (i'll try to stop talking about languages now, i just get so excited!)</p>
  <p class="post">...</p>
  <p class="post">anyways, the trip was a lot of fun. we visited a few carnicerías and panaderías to great success. i
    wish i could find some butchers around boston to get more cuts of meat than what i'm used to. she actually made
    pozole recently and we have some pig shoulder left over, so maybe i'll try to find a recipe for it and experiment.

  <p class="post">a shorter post, but a helpful one nonetheless. it's nice to reflect on things that happen in my life
    because it puts into perspective just how grateful i am for certain things; in this case, having such an intimate relationship with someone outside
    my own culture. i truly value the perspective that i gain and the awesome things i learn. here's to another
