    <p style="color:white" id="post">most software manufactured by a large corporation seems to just be poorly designed and awful. you can really taste the lack of passion and desire for a paycheck in a lot of mainstream software design today. maybe its just incompetence – i dont know. the point is shit sucks dude. and with all this faux ai shit being shoved down our throats i cant help but feel that these people are actively working against us <br><br> 
        take microsoft's windows 11 for instance: the settings are an absolute mess of things that i definitely dont want to do and will likely never plan to! things like displaying seconds in your system clock are a GARGANTUAN task. go ahead! try to figure it out without looking stuff up. these people* didnt have you, the USER, in mind while designing the USER interface. seriously, who's fucking up this bad here?</p>
        <p style="color:white" id="footnote">*if you think im being judgemental here, i am. i feel as though we as the little guys reserve a right to judge our tech overlords at least a little.</p>
        <p style="color:white" id="post">i really do lose it a lot of the time when i use software designed by big tech. another anecdote includes my smart tv that my girlfriend and i got for our apartment. <br>...<br> the thing BLOWS! it takes so much cognitive effort to use and it only really gets in your way! just today, i was trying to open the damn thing to watch some slop and it wouldnt stop playing a live broadcast of god-knows-what-team's football game.<br><br>
    shut the hell up! i dont wanna watch football! <br>...<br>
    it seems like every time i want to actually engage with a platform one of these big tech companies offer, i have to sacrifice something in some way. that's why ive moved away from <a href="https://starbreaker.org/">(para)</a>social media. i want to use my computer and not have to give up my time or energy in an unfulfilling way. <br><br>
    though this is the case with most software, i think a more do-it-yourself approach to computers can make them less of a burden on my life and more of a machinal extension of myself. i started that today by setting up a <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">pi-hole</a>. what it does boils down to blocking trackers and ads on a network-wide scale. i originally did it because i didnt want ads on youtube on my smart tv in addition to not having <a href="https://youtu.be/XHVxm12NbrY?t=18">tim apple's</a> nose all up in my business all the time. <br><br>
    additional things ive thought about are setting up my own sort of music playing system using just a raspberry pi, a screen, and some audio files (obviously a speaker and all the good audio stuff too but whatever). <br>...<br>
    i want to start treating computers not as devices for stimulation laden with advertisements and predatory business practices, as they are coming to be – but as an extension and advancement of the things people were already doing: listening to music, playing games, doing some work, being creative, etc. <br><br>
    as for the whole music making side of things, i love hardware! i think interfacing something with buttons and optionally some other modulation media with a computer-sound-producer aids in the creative process greatly. i find that i hate looking at a screen after a while because its very easy for my primary ego reference to dissolve behind the screen.
    <br><br> i hope in the coming months to do more weird computer shit while also... using...... computers............ less? <br> oxymoronic, i know, but you get the idea.</p>
