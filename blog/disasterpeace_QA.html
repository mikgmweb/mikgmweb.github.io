  <h1 style="color:white; font-family:firacode;">disasterpeace berklee Q+A</h1>
  <hr>
  <p class="post">
i had the privilege of being able to attend a Q+A with <a href="https://disasterpeace.com/#">rich vreeland [disasterpeace]</a> at berklee's <a href="https://www.instagram.com/berkleevgmc/">video game music club</a> (opens instagram). the interview was conducted primarily by the president of the club, with a public Q+A section near the end. last thing: a disclaimer! i *heavily* paraphrased everything and these exist more as highly condensed (arguably low quality) notes, hence the "mote cut." i cannot take notes at the speed of conversation, unfortunately. anyways, here are my notes!<br><br>
Q: vgmc lore?<br>
<br>
A: filipo, shota nakama, akash nakar, sean sincalir, qien hao all were there!<br>
<br>
Q: berklee experience?<br>
<br>
A: before berklee didn't have the language to communicate;<br>
   hyper-competitive atmosphere among performers, pivoted to EPD<br>
<br>
Q: talk about fez music; what makes chiptune feel chiptune?<br>
<br>
A: unfiltered waveforms, recontextualized those sounds to be more cinematic<br>
<br>
Q: hyper light drifter; what inspired you to make it the way it is?<br>
<br>
A: use piano to create a dichotomy. end of something is a great place to break rules<br>
<br>
Q: anything else about synths that draws you to them?<br>
<br>
A: expression; control over timbre is fun and highly expressive<br>
   played with nord modular synth software<br>
<br>
Q: january; speak<br>
<br>
A: game jam at MIT media lab, felt inspired to make something of his own<br>
   used flixl -- gradually built, getting more and more technical<br>
   if this note --> list of notes that work; highly probabilistic<br>
<br>
Q: helped with working on mini metro?<br>
<br>
A: went back to january, cleaned it up; people played it<br>
   mini metro devs wanted a procedural score!<br>
<br>
Q: how has your process evolved, particularly with paradise marsh?<br>
<br>
A: inspired by botw; phrase-based open world music<br>
   3 elements: pad bass keys; manipulate phrases in generative way<br>
   play with timing offset; transposition; reversal; FX<br>
<br>
Q: rhythm game time; different process?<br>
<br>
A: wife texted him, responded immediately<br>
   anyways, dont need to worry about motifs, have fun!<br>
   no strong external goal<br>
   worked on everhood: eternity edition<br>
<br>
R: past the ambition stage, maximizing time<br>
   solar ash was a grind<br>
<br>
Q: solar ash?<br>
<br>
A: worked more on audio systems -- learning unreal engine technical sound design<br>
<br>
Q: movies time; different process for movies?<br>
<br>
A: process is as different as you want it to be<br>
   "what do you think the game needs?"<br>
   dont be overly ambitious -- interactive music is hard to do well<br>
   write something BEFORE prototyping generative part<br>
   film is painting by numbers -- fill in music more statically<br>
   film is more freeing because you do more music writing than coding<br>
<br>
Q: how did you get here?<br>
<br>
A: say yes to EVERYTHING<br>
   make mistakes to understand what you like and dislike<br>
   try as many things as you can<br>
   pick your battles<br>
<br>
Q: writing standalone music; comparable to rhythm games?<br>
<br>
A: yes, learned that he worked better with a concept<br>
   writing music for yourself is not necessarily like that, blank page is too freeing<br>
   latch onto a given concept<br>
<br>
Q: genres, artists, other inspirations?<br>
<br>
A: chrono-cross, koji kondo, flowx<br>
   picked up different influences along the way<br>
   interested in many different genres throughout his career<br>
   bernard herman for orchestral music<br>
<br>
Q: circle back to berklee --> advice for what people should focus on?<br>
<br>
A: had a busy musical life outside of school<br>
   didnt integrate well with school life<br>
   focused more on message boards and solo artist life<br>
   connecting with like-minded people<br>
   boston 8-bit, other outside school things<br>
   used classes to experiment<br>
   berklee is notorious for having a "berklee sound"<br>
<br>
