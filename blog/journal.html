    <p>struggling a little lately with building and keeping momentum. i really think i just feel like this after every weekend that comes to pass. my schedule consists of a ton of work on (monday) tuesday and wednesday, then a deep crash on thursday through sunday, sometimes spilling over into monday... not good. i'd like to experiment more with other schedules. watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALaTm6VzTBw">cgp grey video</a>(opens youtube) while rotting that talked about having a 2-1-3-1 system of working, treating wednesday as a day off. could be an interesting experiment to try for the rest of this week and the coming one. i keep retyping different excuses to try to consider the days i have where ive done very little work as days where ive done no work at all. a testament to my internalized need to work work work work work work work work w</p>

    <p>job interview went well! i applied for your run-of-the-mill sit-at-a-desk-and-do-nothing needlessly-hyphenated job and was offered a programming job! the details are pretty interesting and why im writing this entry. for one, the project is gonna be built using <a href="https://dart.dev/">dart</a>. im not particularly familiar with it, but upon looking into it, it seems like object-oriented hell. they have support for running functions as arguments, though... so that could be fun. im pretty pumped since the boss hasnt really figured out what database to use yet and asked for some ideas while i was there. he's trying to get away from using <a href="https://www.glideapps.com/">glide</a>, which seems needlessly expensive when something like SQL exists (and is what glide seems to be based on). SQL programming does not look fun, but it seems like itll be a good thing to learn. im most excited about the backend, though, since im running a cool little raspberry pi jellyfin/pi-hole/filebrowser server. im excited to get paid to do cool shit for once, rather than just working to keep the lights on.</p>

    <p>had a meeting with my professor today, talked about my wave terrain hardware implementation im currently working on. im trying to figure out exactly how to get the pi and arduino powered via the same source... i'd love to fiddle with some batteries, but i cant help but fear im going to have to buy some other kind of power supply and break it out into both boards individually. been thinking about adding a screen and running love2d on the pi for a superformula visualization. im also a bit worried about communicating serial information between the pi and arduino. serial stuff in C i DOUBT will be fun, though i think it will be at the same time. we shall see i suppose... ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯</p>
