    <p class="post">had a meeting with my professor today, talked about my wave terrain hardware implementation im currently working on. im trying to figure out exactly how to get the pi and arduino powered via the same source... i'd love to fiddle with some batteries, but i cant help but fear im going to have to buy some other kind of power supply and break it out into both boards individually. been thinking about adding a screen and running love2d on the pi for a superformula visualization. im also a bit worried about communicating serial information between the pi and arduino. serial stuff in C i DOUBT will be fun, though i think it will be at the same time. we shall see i suppose... ¯\_ (ツ)_/¯</p>
