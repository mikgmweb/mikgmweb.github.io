  <p class="post">this month was full of grindy stuff. not many new things to say, but i have a feeling next month is
    gonna go way harder. if you want an
    outline of how this is laid out and why, see <a href="11-04-2024.html">my post for october</a>.
    without further ado, lets get into it</p>
  <p class="post"><a href="#social">social</a></p>

  <p class="post">november was an uninteresting month socially. i didn't really have too much time to hang out with
    friends
    because of various projects i had to work on for school, as well as some things that'll be outlined in the
    grind.</p>
  <p class="post">though few, i did hang out with a few friends here and there on various nights. one of the more
    notable ones
    was actually with my partner's friend. we organized our storage area with her then went out on the town, not
    before picking up her car since it got towed. i was pretty surprised because i didn't really expect that to
    happen, though it makes sense in retrospect considering she parked right near the path the towing company patrol
    truck (no idea what these guys are called) usually takes. all else aside, it was a nice reprieve from midterms.
  </p>
  <p class="post">one of my biggest goals for next year is to get more out of my friendships by making a conscious
    effort to do
    so. i'm not that good at planning things out at the moment, but i hope to get better.</p>
  <h3 style="color:white; font-family:firacode;" id="aspirations">aspirations</h3>
  <p class="post">the main thing i really had to worry about was a project in my mixing class where i had 4 weeks to do
    ALL of
    the audio for a scene from a movie. i chose the kung fu fight scene in the matrix. it ended up being pretty fun,
    though i wish i hadn't put it off 'til the last minute. i know i'm not alone in that sentiment, since my
    classmates did the same thing, but i still don't think its a good idea for me to do that. a lot of my growth
    thus far has been breaking those habits to a certain extent. if i were assigned this project a year ago, i
    would've waited until 3 days before it was do to <em>start</em>.</p>
  <p class="post">aside from that, i've just been slowly chipping away at my sound design reel. i hope to apply to <a
      href="https://www.riotgames.com/en">riot games</a> at some point soon since they have a summer internship
    opportunity open at the moment. i plan to truly finish my reel while im alone in our apartment this month.
    you'll have to hear about how that goes in the next monthly post!</p>
  <p class="post">another thing that's been on my mind is whether or not i should take a gap semester this coming
    semester. i
    think it would be good to use that opportunity to work and save up a ton of money, given my position at saltie
    girl. i'd also be able to take some time off of school to reflect on my own creativity a little, which has been
    troubling me lately. i find it difficult to get into the flow of things when i have a million different things
    going on.</p>
  <p class="post">my main argument for taking a gap is that i'd be able to save up some rent money and not be working
    during the
    semester, which is what has been killing me lately. however, it feels like a pretty big decision. i'm gonna talk
    it over with my closest people first. if you're reading this and you have my contact info, feel free to tell me
    what <em>you</em> think. i need all the input i can get.*</p>
  <p class="footnote">*when i make decisions i usually try to apply some degree of "bayesian" logic, which is the only
    useful concept
    that has come from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/">lesswrong</a> to me</p>
  <h3 style="color:white; font-family:firacode;" id="the grind">the grind</h3>
  <p class="post">as you can imagine based on the previous section, work has been giving me some cognitive trouble. i'm
    currently
    training to become a server, but things are going slowly due to staff shortages. while upsetting, the situation
    is somewhat of a blessing because finals are soon approaching. i've made more friends there as well, having
    improved my reputation somewhat (at least in my own head).</p>
  <p class="post">...</p>
  <p class="post"> that's it! see you next month!</p>
