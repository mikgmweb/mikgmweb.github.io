            <p class="fira" style="font-size:x-large; line-height:200%;">Mike McDonald is a sound designer and instrument builder. Currently, he is majoring in
Electronic Production and Design with a Minor in Psychology at <a href=https://berklee.edu">Berklee</a>. He chose this path because,
while he is a musician, his entire academic life before college consisted of STEM. After deciding to
pivot to music, Mike was able to spread his wings and use his experience gained from the <a href="https://governors.pwcs.edu/">physics and
engineering program he took at GMU</a>. He’s known for his sound design work on <a href="https://www.lmthegame.com/">Lake Minnewaska</a>,
where he used his knowledge of game audio conventions and production techniques to create an
immersive experience for a student project. Mike also designs and builds instruments, bridging his
STEM-focused background with his musical experience. He takes joy in creating experiences for
everyone and tools for musicians. Mike’s skills range from proficiency in Bash scripting and Lua to
knowledge of electronic production conventions and signal flow to soldering and hardware design. His
contact information and additional info regarding his skills can be found on his <a href="card.html">contact card page</a></p>
